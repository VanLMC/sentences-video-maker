# sentences-video-maker

This project webscrapes a webpage with multiple sentences and generates a 10 minute video based on it. It uses google text to speach to generate the audio and ffmpeg to glue everything together and render the video

You can see me explain this project in my youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUVC9SBFmjM)
